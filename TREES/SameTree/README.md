# ðŸ”— Leetcode Problem 100 â€“ Same Tree

## ðŸ“„ Problem Statement
Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if:
- They are structurally identical.
- The nodes have the same value.

## ðŸ’» Example

### Input:
p = [1,2,3]
q = [1,2,3]

## âœ… Approach: Recursive DFS

- Compare root nodes.
- Recursively check left and right children.
- Base cases:
  - If both nodes are `null`, return `true`.
  - If only one is `null`, return `false`.
  - If values mismatch, return `false`.

ðŸ§  Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes.

Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack).
