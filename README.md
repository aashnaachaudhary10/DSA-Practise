## ✍️ Problem File Format

Every file follows a consistent format with:

- 🔗 Problem Link
- 💡 Approach
- ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity
- 📝 Well-structured code

**Example:**

```python
# Problem: Valid Anagram
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/
# Approach: Frequency Map
# Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

def isAnagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    return sorted(s) == sorted(t)
